### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kasey and I am currently studying Aerospace engineering at ISU!
I decided to persue aerospace engineering because:
### Planes are cool!

I am fascinated with aircraft and love knowing and figuring out how things work.

âš¡ Fun fact: I love the creative aspects of life! I enjoy music and playing guitar (though I don't get the time to play enough) and am fascinated by other artistic avenues such as playing around in Blender or even building furniture (at least in one case).
